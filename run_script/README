Use run_script.sh to generate virtual trace file with target executable program.

[How to use]
	./run_script.sh --input [executable]
		Run [executable] with generating after-cache virtual address trace.
	./run_script.sh --input [executable] --pref
		Run [executable] with generating after-cache virtual address trace with cpu prefetcher in the valgrind cache simulator. 
		To generate more accurate trace, recommend use --pref option.
		
	Output:
		[cg_result.out] file: Virtual address trace + Virtual-Physical mapping information
		[proclog.log] file: Redirection of process standard output
		[callgrind.out.#]: Output from vanilla Valgrind (We don't use)
