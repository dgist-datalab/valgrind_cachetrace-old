Use run_script.sh to start memory tracing. It generates virtual trace file with target executable program.
It is a very simple script, so you can modify this script as you want.

You can modify this script as you want.
Line 37 and 41 is necessary. 
Line 37 runs valgrind to generate virtual memory address trace to the [.out] file through stderr.
and line 41 sends the pid of target process to the kernel.
Upon receiving the target pid, the kernel outputs the VPN-PFN mapping information of the faulting address to the stderr of the corresponding pid.
Therefore, [.out] file contains two different information (virtual address trace + VPN-PFN mapping information)

[How to use]
	./run_script.sh --input [executable]
		Run [executable] with generating after-cache virtual address trace.
	./run_script.sh --input [executable] --pref
		Run [executable] with generating after-cache virtual address trace with cpu prefetcher in the valgrind cache simulator. 
		To generate more accurate trace, recommend use --pref option.
		
	Output:
		[cg_result.out] file: Virtual address trace + Virtual-Physical mapping information
		[proclog.log] file: Redirection of process standard output
		[callgrind.out.#]: Output from vanilla Valgrind (We don't use)
