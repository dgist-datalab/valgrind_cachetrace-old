	the [.mix] trace file has two information. One is a virtual address trace, and the other is Virtual-Phyiscal mappings.
	This code combines two information and generates a physical address trace. 

	The first line of [.pout] file:
		ok_cnt  none_cnt  ok/total

make_physical_trace_ts.py
	usage: python3 make_physical_trace_ts.py [trace.mix]
	output: trace.phyout

	This script is the same as the one above, but is used when the [.mix] trace file contains timestamps.
	Only line 160 is different.

	In the current version, the scripts for graphs (e.g., ./figures/*.py) don't support an input file including timestamps.
