Plot graphs with generated trace.
Graphs are saved in ./figures/ directory. 

cg_histogram.py
	Input: [.out] trace file from Step 3
	Output: [.eps] graph and log files

	python3 cg_histogram.py -i [trace.out] 	
		plot graph (VA - # of accesses)
	python3 cg_histogram.py -i [trace.out] --cdf
		plot sorted cdf graph (VA - # of accesses)
	python3 cg_histogram.py -i [trace.out] --scatter
		plot graph (elapsed time - VA)


cg_pa_histogram.py
	Input: [.phyout] trace file from Step 4 and log files. You need to run cg_historam.py first to create log files.
	Output: [.eps] graph files.

	python3 cg_pa_histogram.py -i [trace.phyout] 	
		plot graph (PA - # of accesses)
	python3 cg_pa_histogram.py -i [trace.phyout] --cdf
		plot sorted cdf graph (PA - # of accesses)
	python3 cg_pa_histogram.py -i [trace.phyout] --scatter
		plot graph (elapsed time - PA)
