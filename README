This tool generates a physical address trace of the target application.

[How to use]
Step 1. Install Valgrind
	Go to valgrind/ dir and follow the install manual in the README.

Step 2. Install kernel in your system
	Go to kernel/ dir and run install.sh to install kernel build files.

Step 3. Run target application with our script to generate raw trace file.
	You can use run_script.sh in the run_script/ dir.
	When you run run_script.sh with the target executable file as an input, 
	the script will run Valgrind to generate after-cache virtual trace 
	and send the target pid to the kernel to generate Virtual-Phyiscal mapping.
	Detailed manual is in the README in run_script/.

	Now, you can run only one target program at once.

Step 4. Create the physical address trace from raw trace files
	Use make_physical_trace.py in after_run/ dir.
	After step 3, you can get raw trace file, [.out].
	In step 4, you can get the physical trace file [.phyout] by using the python code.
	Detailed manual is in the README in after_run/.


	After step 4, you will get [.phyout] file as a final output.
		Format: [Read/Write] [Physical Address]
		Example:
			...
			R 0x1234
			W 0x2345
			...

	You can plot some graphs with trace files by using after_run/graph/*.py
